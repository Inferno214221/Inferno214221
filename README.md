# About Me
### OS
I run a heavily modified Fedora Linux 36 install with XFCE (Not the spin verison) on a Acer Nitro AN515-57 Laptop with an i7-11800H, a RTX 3050 Mobile and 16GB of RAM. I currently run Windows (Cringe) only for games, as I dislike the idea of purchasing a game that I can't play.
### Programming
I have written programs in Java, Node.js, C++, C#, Bash, Python and BrainF**k, although I don't specialise in any specific language.
### Gaming
Favourite Games (Not in Order):
 - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
 - Super Smash Brothers Ultimate / Crusade CMC+
 - Portal 2
 - Assasin's Creed
 - Subnautica
 - Ark
 - Apex
 - Skyrim
 - Combusted Pixel Dungeon (Play Free Now)
 - Old Games
### D&D
I enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition, although I don't know that I will move to One D&D cause WotC keep making very dumb decisions. I play D&D with a heavily modified list of rules and in heavily combat focused games (some of which I DM).
